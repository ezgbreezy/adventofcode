Advent of Code Day 1 2022: Counting Calories\

Lessons
- Wrote too much code before testing functionality. 
Broken conditionals were the source of issues that I had been trying
to solve by other means, further preventing me from finding the issue.
Only by deleting a majority of the code and returning to testing the
conditionals revealed that the logic was broken from the beginning.
Test each incremental piece of code before continuing. If hashing out
logic is desired, use pseudocode.

- By adding in each piece slowly and testing, I was able to get a much clearer understanding of the control flow of the program.
