# Advent of Code Day 1 2022: Counting Calories

## Lessons
### Writing too much code before testing
Broken conditionals were the source of issues that I had been trying to solve by other means further preventing me from finding the issue. Only by deleting a majority of the code and returning to testing the conditionals revealed that the logic was broken from the beginning. By adding in each piece slowly and testing, I was able to get a much clearer understanding of the control flow of the program. I've experienced this lesson before, but after building up skills and confidence, I lost the habit of frequent testing.

## Key takeaways
### Write, test, repeat
Test each incremental piece of code before continuing. If hashing out logic is desired, use pseudocode.
